## Quantum Vector Embeddings (QuantumVE) 


### ðŸ”§Install environment

1. Create environment with conda:

```
conda create -n QuantumVE python=3.10 -y
conda activate QuantumVE
```

2. Install dependencies

```
git clone https://github.com/sebasmos/QuantumVE.git

pip install -r requirement.txt
```

### Contribute

1. Folder `Focker-Plank-Solution` contains the Fokker-Planck which examplifies the one-dimensional Fokker-Planck equation, including parameter inference, numerical spectrum calculation with varied boundary conditions, and numerical simulation on finite domains. Tutorials under Focker-Plank Solution folder where inspired by [juliankappler](https://github.com/juliankappler/fokker-planck)


1.  `q_Net` contains the implementation of audio classification via vector embeddings using qiskit. See Q_Net [docs](https://github.com/sebasmos/QuantumVE/blob/main/q_Net/README.md) for more details on VE generation.
