# Machine learning for quantum mechanics


### ðŸ”§Install environment

1. Create environment with conda:

```
conda create -n quantumdeep python=3.10 -y
conda activate quantumdeep
```

2. Install dependencies

```
git clone https://github.com/sebasmos/QuantumDeep.git
cd QuantumDeep
pip install -r requirement.txt
```

### Contribute

1. Folder `Focker-Plank-Solution` contains the Fokker-Planck which examplifies the one-dimensional Fokker-Planck equation, including parameter inference, numerical spectrum calculation with varied boundary conditions, and numerical simulation on finite domains. This module is invaluable for analyzing diverse phenomena governed by the Fokker-Planck equation, enhancing research across scientific and engineering disciplines. It draws inspiration from the repository by Julian Kappler at https://github.com/juliankappler/fokker-planck/tree/main.

Tutorials under Focker-Plank Solution folder where inspired by [juliankappler](https://github.com/juliankappler/fokker-planck)
